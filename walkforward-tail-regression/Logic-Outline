Main logic

User inputs
1. User inputs: log(OHLC) data, predictor variable, n bars lookahead return (target)
2. User select: model specification, (e.g., OLS with or without interaction terms).
3. Walk‑forward configuration: training‑window length, step size, and look‑ahead horizon.

User options (flags)
--------------------
- Add interaction / square terms?  
- Cap outliers at 1.5*IQR?
- Standardise or normalise predictors?  
- Run step‑wise feature selection with k‑fold CV (no CV)?  
- Tune model hyper‑parameters via CV grid?  

Model logic:
1. Data cleaning => drop Nans, 0 volume days
3. Instantiate  the model specified by the user
4. Walk‑forward loop over index i:
4.1 If **i** is a training index:
    - Define train slice: past *N* bars excluding look‑ahead buffer.  
    - Apply optional scaling
    - Optional: step‑wise feature selection  
    - Optional: adjust model hyperparameters with k-fold cross validation
    - Fit model to the training slice
    - Optimise long or short or both, prediction percentiles that maximise training‑sample Sharpe ratio subject to a minimum‑trade constraint.
    - is the model satisfactory? if yes put it to test
    - adjust next train index

5. if the model is ready do the following:
  - Use the trained model to predict return between index [i] and [i+1]
  - Is the prediction below/above the computed threshold?
    if yes:
      - a short/long position is opened for time = lookahead horizon
  - Charge commission per side (bps) on any position chang
  - is the testing window over ? 
  if yes collect in sample out of sample P&L and return to point 4.1.

Outputs
-------
• Series of net out‑of‑sample log returns.  
• Fold‑by‑fold metrics (Sharpe, drawdown, trade count).  
• Stored model coefficients and threshold levels for each retrain.
