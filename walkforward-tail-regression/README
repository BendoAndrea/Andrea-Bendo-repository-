Walk‑Forward Tail Regression (wft) is a modular Python toolkit for evaluating statistical trading models in a walk‑forward back‑test. The codebase inludes:
• classes for data cleaning, quick exploratory analysis with plotting utilities, model fitting, and walk‑forward validation;
• cross validation whithin a step‑wise feature selection algorithim:
• hyper‑parameter cross‑validation;
• reference models (OLS, feed‑forward neural net); and
• performance/robustness metrics to validate out‑of‑sample results.
